			“治大国如烹小鲜”，里根总统就很欣赏这句道家的治国名言。我之所以更倾向于共和党的政策，主要原因就在这。不过川总，是实在的，实在是马尾栓豆腐，提不起来。历史上有那个独裁者在其有生之年停止独裁了？能继续独裁一天，就绝不只独裁半晌，无一例外。<span
				class="latin">to
				be a dictator only for the first day</span>”，你问他自己信吗？

			Years ago, I listened to the radio, the greatest tenor Luciano Pavarotti was talking about singing. He said
			singing is just a controlled screaming. Everyone can scream, only a few can control their screaming, and it
			takes years of practice to be able to do the control part well.

			So, keep shouting hard Joecrap, someday people will enjoy listening to your crap.

			Again, thanks for sharing, a bit messy (通俗，易懂，简洁) though. Let me recap what I have read.
		</p>
		<p class="latin">
			Bitcoin is legal or being legalized in most industrial countries, such as the U.S., Japan, and European
			countries. To be clear, ‘legal “ means it is considered property, not really currency, so you can trade it
			as stocks or gold and you need to file taxes for the trade.
		</p>
		<p class="latin">
			China and India are on their way to legalize Bitcoin and a few small countries have gone farther, trying to
			make it a legal tender, meaning to make it a government-issued currency.
		</p>
		<p class="latin">
			To use it as currency, you need to go through a mid-layer. I believe it basically sells your Bitcoin holding
			for money to buy anything. Same as buying anything using stock, you have to sell your stock first.
		</p>
		<p class="latin">
			Did I get it right?
		</p>
		<p>
			———
		</p>
		<p class="latin">
			Will there be multiple Coins or just one worldwide?
			Will governments lose control of currencies?
			If governments have no control to currencies at all, will Coin(s) eventually become a new type of “invisible
			hand”?
		</p>
		<p>
			———
		</p>
		<p class="latin">
			Wow, thanks a lot for sharing!
		</p>
		<p class="latin">
			Let’s follow your logic, forget about cdbc and those small crypto players. Assuming Bitcoin will be a
			standout eventually, “the question really is what are the fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Fiat
			money”. So what are those differences? What are the pros and cons?

			八爷在数字货币上花了很多时间和精力，我现在脑子有点丢转儿，跟不上趟。在没有祂的参与下，八爷是不是用通俗易懂的语言，简单列举一下数字货币的实现到底有哪些利与弊（如果有利有弊的话）？另外数字货币是会在全世界同时实现呢还是会先在少数几个特民主或特专制的国家实现呢？
