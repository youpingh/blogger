			Hello Class C9, and everyone here, my name is Youping Hu and I'm this year's Chinese teacher of the class C9. At the first day of school, I expected 9th graders, but instead, I found myself teaching a group of 6th to 8th graders. While greeting those young kids, I told myself I need to be more gentle to avoid making those little ones cry. Well, I was wrong, they are much tougher than I thought. Using their own words, they are good at making noises. I don't mind noises in the classroom as long as they are in Chinese. I believe that learning a language is a bit different from learning some other things, like math. Prictice, especially practice in real life conversions, is the best way to learn a language. So oftentimes, we just chatted loudly in the classroom and jumped topics randomly, and everyone enjoyed it. Give you an example. We had a lesson about Chinese food and a student asked me about the Beijing roasted duck. That's my hometown dish so I told them in detail how it's cooked and served to the table, and of course the great taste of it. While describing how the chef slicing the golden brown, rosted duck at the table side, they yelled at me: Hey, Mr. Hu, you are making us hungry.

			At the beginning of this school year, I worried about the difficulty level of the textbook as it was for 9th graders. But to my surprise, in just a couple of classes, they started complaining the textbook is too easy and boring. One of the good things of GWCA is that a teacher is able to make adjustments to meet what students need. I replaced more than half of the textbook's contents with some more advanced stories, essays, social network messages. It turned out to be the right thing to do. My students could handle them without any problems and more importantly, they showed more interest in those contents. They've done a great job and I'm very proud of them.

			When I was a boy, there was a slogan hanging on every classroom wall that says: study hard and make progress everyday. I think that is too much for a student. I'd like to alter it a little bit: study smart and enjoy learning everyday.

			Well, looks like just a blink of an eye, accompanied with a lot of noises, the school is over. To my students, I hope you continue your learning here in GWCA. Good luck, the class C9!

			Thank you all, and I'll switch to Chinese now.

			今年教C9+，所以开学第一天，觉得应该看到教室里一群九年级的学生，可实际上，来的是几个六到八年级的学生。看着这几个身量不高，变声期还没完的小孩子，心说这学期说话得悠着点儿，别一不留神再弄哭两个。不过后来发现，这完全是多虑了，这几个，一个比一个淘，要是不管着点儿，他们能把教室吵翻。用他们自己的话说，我们吵得很。当然了，只要是用中文，我倒不在乎他们吵。学语言和学其它课不一样，聊天，特别是和实际生活有关的聊天，最能提高。

			我们班的课，每次基本上都是在吵吵闹闹中上完的。有时就从课文中的一个情节开聊，聊着聊着就跳到不知哪去了，还得赶紧往回找。有一篇课文讲到各地美食风味，有个同学就问我，说老师你是北京人，是不是老吃烤鸭呀？我说就是现在，在北京吃顿烤鸭也不能算家常便饭。随后我们就说起烤鸭的种种趣事，从填鸭说起，最后说到鸭子烤好后，厨师是怎么在桌子边上把那只油光闪闪、烤的焦黄的鸭子一刀一刀片出来的过程：“老师，你把我们都说馋了。”这会儿有个家里是从南京来的学生问道：“老师，你说北京烤鸭和南京咸水鸭哪个好吃？” ……

			我上小学的时候，全中国的教室里都挂得有一个标语：好好学习，天天向上。现在想起来，那个要求太高了，也许应该换成：灵活学习，享受学习。
