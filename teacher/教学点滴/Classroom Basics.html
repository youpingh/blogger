		<h3>Create a Classroom (Admin/Teacher)</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>From the admin console, set the classroom membership to allow personal Gmail account owners to join the
				classroom. (https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/6173514) for more information.</li>
			<li>Login as a teacher (c9@greatwallchineseacademy.org)</li>
			<li>Go to Google Classroom (https://classroom.google.com/h)</li>
			<li>Create a new classroom (click on the plus sign)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			When the process is completed, the teacher is the primary teacher (owner) of the classroom and you may
			invite
			other teachers to the classroom as co-teachers. And the classroom now is ready to use.
		</p>
		<h3>Invite Students to Your Classroom (Teacher)</h3>
		<p>
			First of all, all the students must have a Google account (Gmail) to join the classroom. If anyone doesn’t
			have a Google account, ask him/her to create one first.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are three ways to invite students:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>By invitation. From the classroom home page, click on People and then the “+” icon</li>
			<li>By class code. From the classroom homepage, copy the class code and give it to the students. They need
				to login into their Google account, go to https://classroom.google.com/, and click the “+” icon to join
				the classroom by the class code. </li>
			<li>By invite link. From the classroom homepage, click on the Display icon, copy the invite link, and give
				the link to the students. They can simply join the classroom from a browser using the link.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Create and Assign an Assignment (Teacher)</h3>
		<p>
			An assignment is an instructional document set for the students to do one piece of homework. It may contain
			a list of Google Docs documents, YouTube video clips, audio clips, and some other Google files like slides,
			spreadsheets, etc. When an assignment is assigned, the students will be able to follow the instructions to
			do the assignment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are the steps to create a new assignment:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to Classwork and click on the Create icon and select “Assignment”</li>
			<li>Create a Google Docs file and other types of Google files for detailed instructions.</li>
			<li>Add audio clips, YouTube video clips, and other types of files as attachments.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Note that for most of the assignments, they only need one Google Docs file as an instruction. All others are
			optional.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you need to make a copy of the assignment for each student, e.g. everyone needs to create a new PPT for a
			presentation, you may choose a file attribute to do so. If the “make a copy for each student” is selected, a
			copy will be made for each student when the assignment gets assigned. The students can work on their copies
			from the assignment page.
		</p>
		<p>
			Review the instructions and attachments. When they are ready, you may assign the assignment to all the
			students or selected ones. The assignment can be done manually or by schedule. When it gets assigned, the
			students will be notified by email and they can start doing homework immediately. After the assignment, you
			may use this page to un-assign or reassign this assignment to the selected students. (check or uncheck
			students)
		</p>
		<h3>Check Homework Online (Teacher)</h3>
		<p>
			When an assignment is turned in, you can check the assignment by clicking on it.
		</p>
		<p>
			You could make comments, suggestions, and anything you want to tell your student about the homework
			assignment he/she just turned in. And return it to the student with a grade if everything is okay. Or return
			it without a grade if you want the student to make some changes. The student will get notified when the
			assignment is returned to him/her. If he/she needs to make some changes as instructed, he/she will re-submit
			the assignment.
		</p>
		<h3>Do Homework Online (Student)</h3>
		<p>
			Receives an email from the teacher and click the Open button to get started, or go to the Classroom homepage
			and select an assignment to get started.
		</p>
		<p>
			Read the instructions and then start working on the assignment. You may
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Click on the assignment to start working on it.</li>
			<li>Click on the attachment to listen to the audio or watch the video clips.</li>
			<li>Click on the “Add or create” link to add an attachment to your assignment.</li>
			<li>Add a private comment to communicate with your teacher.</li>
			<li>And finally, click on the “Turn in” button to turn in the assignment.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			If everything is good, your teacher will return your assignment WITH a grade. If your teacher wants you to
			make some changes, he/she will return the assignment WITHOUT a grade. The teacher might have some comments
			in the assignment to instruct you on what kind of changes you need to make. In that case, you need to make
			the necessary changes and resubmit the assignment. While making changes, you need to accept or reject your
			teacher's suggestions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that when an assignment is turned in, the teacher will not get notified until he/she checks the status
			of your assignment. You may make a simple private comment while turning in the assignment so that the
			teacher will be notified immediately.
